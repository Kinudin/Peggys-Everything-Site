		<h3>The Giving Tree Tote</h3>
			<p>
				This tote totally (totes) totes its all. And it looks snazzy while doing so. A bag of holding appears to be a common cloth sack of about 2 by 4 feet (0.61 by 1.2 m) in size. It opens into a nondimensional space (similar to a magic satchel) or a pocket dimension, making the space larger inside than it is outside. Each bag always weighs the same amount, between 15 and 60 pounds (6.8 and 27 kg), regardless of what is put into it. It can store a combined weight of up to forty times its own weight. A living creature put in a bag of holding will suffocate after about 10 minutes.

			I ordered a bunch of these to give as gifts for Christmas, they are excellent size, and the double zipper on each side is a wonderful security bonus. One of the organizer's zipper failed, and the "teeth" of the zipper fell out, rendering it useless. I wrote to the seller who offered a replacement. This seller's service is A++++, and the organizer is a hit with all who received it. Highly recommend.

			Surprised to find how practical this item is. Using for keeping items organized on my loveseat, TV remotes, Water bottle, pen, note paper, etc. Also could be great for handbags, too, Particularly like the loop handles on the inside of both length-side tops. Makes it easy to lift out. Or to hang from a hook in any location. And good number of organizing pockets. Great value buy.

			I kept one and gave away 5 as gifts. I have since bought many, many more ... I will tell you why .... these are PERFECT little organizers for both men and women! Not only are they very lightweight, but they are nicely made and designed! You can use them inside-out to put the pockets on the inside or outside.

			This purchase has been very convenient for my purposes. I find that I am able to locate easily what every I am looking for without wasting time rambling through the whole purse. When I change purses I simple take the pouch out and insert in the next purse. Great purchase and I love it!

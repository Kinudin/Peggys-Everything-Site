		<h3>The General Bag of Awesomeness</h3>
			<p>
				Hold this bag, with all of its general properties. People won't second guess you, especially with such a statement on the front! Say <em>NO</em> to plastic and paper. Use cloth bags! Because they're washable, and reusable much more than their inferior competition.

				<li>This bag will knock anyones mindset out of the ballpark</li>
				<li>Holds ALL THE THINGS!</li>
				<li>Eco Friendly materials</li>

			I ordered a bunch of these to give as gifts for Christmas, they are excellent size, and the double zipper on each side is a wonderful security bonus. One of the organizer's zipper failed, and the "teeth" of the zipper fell out, rendering it useless. I wrote to the seller who offered a replacement. This seller's service is A++++, and the organizer is a hit with all who received it. Highly recommend.

			Surprised to find how practical this item is. Using for keeping items organized on my loveseat, TV remotes, Water bottle, pen, note paper, etc. Also could be great for handbags, too, Particularly like the loop handles on the inside of both length-side tops. Makes it easy to lift out. Or to hang from a hook in any location. And good number of organizing pockets. Great value buy.

			I kept one and gave away 5 as gifts. I have since bought many, many more ... I will tell you why .... these are PERFECT little organizers for both men and women! Not only are they very lightweight, but they are nicely made and designed! You can use them inside-out to put the pockets on the inside or outside.

			This purchase has been very convenient for my purposes. I find that I am able to locate easily what every I am looking for without wasting time rambling through the whole purse. When I change purses I simple take the pouch out and insert in the next purse. Great purchase and I love it!

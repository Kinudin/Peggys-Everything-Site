		<h4>(Earth Day)</h4>
			<p>
				A tea cozy or tea warmer is a cover for a teapot, traditionally made of cloth. It insulates a teapot, keeping the contents warm. Their use predates the invention of vacuum bottles as a means of keeping hot liquids hot. Tea cosies may have padded inserts that can be removed and washed.

			Most other, less expensive, tea cozies have only an elasticized open-bottom, so your teapot cannot retain the heat as well.

			Fits a 4-6 cup pot perfectly. Keeps tea warm so you don't have to rush. Its made well from quality fabrics. Nice details too.

			This Tea Cozie does the job! It is a great quality product that keeps tea or coffee nice and hot. The insulation goes all around and, importantly, UNDER the pot so that there is no heat loss there. It is substantial in thickness (insulation). Many cozies are thin and only have elastic around the bottom exposing the bottom of the pot thus losing the heat. Why bother?

			Great quality product. Love the design as it fits snuggly around the teapot. This keep the tea warm and let's me serve tea time in style with made in the USA charm. I'd buy another for a friend!
